## List of Experiments

### **Experiment 1: Image and Video Reading and Display**
Develop a Python program using OpenCV to demonstrate image acquisition and video acquisition
by reading images in multiple modes and capturing live video from a camera, displaying and storing
the video stream.

---

### **Experiment 2: Image Transformations**
Develop a Python program using OpenCV to implement geometric transformations including
scaling, translation, and rotation. Display the original and transformed images.

---

### **Experiment 3: Histogram Analysis**
Write a program to compute and plot the histogram of a grayscale image and perform histogram
equalization.

---

### **Experiment 4: Edge Detection**
Design and implement a Python program using OpenCV to perform edge detection based on the
Canny algorithm.

---

### **Experiment 5: Image Enhancement**
Develop a Python program using OpenCV to enhance the quality of a digital image by applying
spatial domain filtering techniques such as smoothing and sharpening

---

### **Experiment 6: Convolution, Filtering, and Motion Blur**
Develop a Python program using OpenCV to apply convolution-based filtering techniques and
simulate motion blur.

---

### **Experiment 7: Corner Detection**
Design and implement a corner detection algorithm using Harris / SIFT Techniques

---

### **Experiment 8: Texture Segmentation using Gabor Filters**
Implement texture segmentation using a bank of Gabor filters in OpenCV

---

### **Experiment 9: Image Segmentation**
Design and implement an image segmentation framework using both classical (thresholding, region-
based) and learning-based approaches. Compare their performance on natural images.

---

### **Experiment 10: Object Detection**
Implement and compare object detection using both traditional computer vision methods and
modern deep learning techniques.
